## About Me

I am a an Associate professor in SEU.


## Research Interests
I have wide interests in computer vision and machine learning. Some specific topics that I have previously worked on are listed below:
- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image segmentation, object detection, point cloud
- **Machine Learning:** few-shot learning, meta-learning, incremental learning, long-tailed recognition, open-set recognition, AutoML, knowledge distillation

## Extracurricular Activities
Besides research, I also actively participate in many extracurricular activities. I was in Top 8 of Good Voice of Universities 2015 in CUMT. I play football regularly and keep a record of  Dribbling & Shooting  in CUMT. I am a fan of  <del>Football Club of Barcelona</del> PSG. My favourite singers are Jacky Cheung and Freddie Mercury.
